    why: ["At Public Health Research & Impact Hub, our work begins with a deep sense of purpose—and a personal story.", " I am a public health researcher from Darfur, Sudan. I've seen firsthand the devastating impact that limited access to maternal health care and weak research systems have on women, mothers, and entire communities. In regions like Darfur, maternal health outcomes remain dangerously poor—not because women don't care, but because the systems meant to protect them are under-researched, under-resourced, and overlooked. ", "Very few studies are conducted in these fragile areas. As a result, there is no strong data to inform decisions, guide interventions, or advocate for funding. Without research, there is no voice. Without voice, there is no change. ", "That is why this hub exists: To ensure that no woman dies giving life because no one studied her reality. To create a space where young African researchers—especially women—can lead evidence that speaks for our people. And to make sure that Darfur and other underserved regions are not just subjects of research—but sources of solutions. ", "Because maternal health is not just a public health issue—it's a matter of justice."],
    founder: ["I'm Dr. Rogya Abdelrasol, a medical doctor and public health professional currently based in Kampala, Uganda. I am deeply passionate about advancing women's health in Africa—particularly in fragile and underserved regions—through research, advocacy, and community-driven solutions.", "I am currently pursuing a Master's in Public Health, with plans to continue my academic journey by earning a PhD in Public Health & Policy, focusing on the reproductive and maternal health stream at a world-leading university. This vision is not just professional—it's personal.", "My path has been one of resilience and purpose. I graduated from medical school in Sudan during a time of war and political instability, all while living with and managing bipolar disorder with awareness and strength. In the last two years, I faced the profound loss of both my parents—my greatest supporters, who walked beside me through my illness and academic journey. This hub is a tribute to their belief in me, and to every girl who dares to rise against the odds.", "Professionally, I've led and supported impactful projects with the Friedrich Ebert Foundation Sudan in partnership with the Goethe-Institut, and volunteered with the Al Sharq Youth Network, delivering youth empowerment and gender-based programs across Sudan. These experiences sharpened my ability to lead, communicate, and design solutions that matter.", "As a multilingual speaker—fluent in Arabic and English, conversational in Spanish, and with basic German—I bring cultural versatility and global curiosity to every space I enter. I'm also a content creator and YouTuber, using my platform to share my journey, amplify public health issues, and empower young women across Africa and the diaspora", "I believe in the power of sharing stories, building community, and creating spaces where research, health, and hope come together. I'm always open to connection, collaboration, and partnership.", "Let's work together to build something that matters"]
